# Photo Gallery
A simple example of implementing a photo gallery using messages with inline keyboards.

There are 3 options available:

1. **Photo Gallery** — Has pagination limited to a list of media.

2. **Photo Carousel** — It has unlimited pagination, the photos in it are repeated in a circle.

3. **Photo Carousel** with Cache — You can save the file_id of sent media so that when editing a message, the files are not uploaded to Telegram servers each time.
